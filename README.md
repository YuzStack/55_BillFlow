## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend Library:** React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework)
- **Design Workflow:** Magic Patterns (AI Generation) to Figma (Visual Audit)

## 🧠 The Design-to-Code Workflow

Unlike course-led projects, BillFlow was built using an original design pipeline. I leveraged Magic Patterns to generate the initial UI concept and then refined the design in Figma. This process eliminated styling guesswork and allowed me to focus entirely on high-fidelity implementation, ensuring the final code perfectly matched the intended visual architecture.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Subscription Management:** A full CRUD interface to add, edit, and track various subscription services and their costs.
- **Donut Chart Visualization:** Implemented a dynamic donut chart to provide a clear, high-level breakdown of expense distribution across different categories.
- **Real-time Financial Tracking:** Automatically calculates total monthly and yearly spends based on active user data.
- **Precision Styling with Tailwind:** Utilized Tailwind CSS to translate Figma designs into a responsive, modern interface with a focus on clean typography and spacing.
- **State-Driven Interactivity:** Managed complex application states to ensure seamless transitions between viewing list data and adding new entries.
